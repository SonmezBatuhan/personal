            <p style="font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; color: brown;">Computer Science Student</p>

            <p>• I’m a Computer Science student driven by a passion for technology, 
                creativity, and innovation. Through mentoring, tutoring, and STEM 
                project management, I’ve developed skills in problem-solving, 
                leadership, and communication while tackling real-world challenges. 
                Inspired by the intersection of technology and creativity, I aim to 
                turn ambitious ideas into impactful realities. Currently, I’m 
                expanding my expertise in software development, focusing on projects 
                that blend technical excellence with creative vision. Eager to explore 
                fields like software, game development, and event production, I’m 
                passionate about leveraging technology to create meaningful experiences 
                and contribute to a better world. </p>

                <p>• Designed and developed a personal portfolio website using only HTML 
                    and CSS, featuring a navigation bar, self-description, and project 
                    details. The page includes a responsive design with two images—one 
                    personal and another related to the project. Interactive elements and 
                    consistent styling were integrated to enhance user experience and ensure 
                    cross-browser compatibility.</p>
